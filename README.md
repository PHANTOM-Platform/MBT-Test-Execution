# Model-based-Testing
The objective of Model-based Testing (MBT) in PHANTOM is to carry out black box testing for both use case applications and individual components of applications on the PHANTOM platform with a focus on global functional and non-functional properties of distributed and parallel computing environments. The SUTs are thus PHANTOM applications within PHANTOM computing environments along with the applicationsâ€™ components. Functional properties test that the SUT is able to produce the expected outputs when given the corresponding inputs under specific configurations. Non-functional properties refer to the SUT performance indicators such as execution time and energy consumption monitored by PHANTOM platform.
